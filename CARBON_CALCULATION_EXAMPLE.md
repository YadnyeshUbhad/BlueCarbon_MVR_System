# Carbon Sequestration Calculation - Worked Example

## üå≥ Example Tree Specifications

Let's calculate the carbon sequestration for a **Neem tree** with the following measurements:

### Input Parameters:
- **Species**: Neem (*Azadirachta indica*)
- **Height**: 12.5 meters
- **DBH (Diameter at Breast Height)**: 0.45 meters (45 cm)
- **Age**: 25 years
- **Location**: Latitude 20.5937¬∞, Longitude 78.9629¬∞ (Central India)

---

## üìê Step-by-Step Calculation

### Step 1: Species-Specific Parameters
For Neem tree:
- **Wood Density (œÅ)**: 680 kg/m¬≥ = 0.68 g/cm¬≥
- **Growth Rate**: 1.1
- **Allometric parameters**: a = 0.26, b = 2.5

### Step 2: Above Ground Biomass (AGB) Calculation

Since DBH > 5cm, we use the **Chave et al. (2014) equation**:

```
AGB = 0.0673 √ó (œÅ √ó DBH¬≤ √ó H)^0.976
```

**Substituting values:**
- œÅ = 0.68 g/cm¬≥
- DBH = 45 cm
- H = 12.5 m

```
AGB = 0.0673 √ó (0.68 √ó 45¬≤ √ó 12.5)^0.976
AGB = 0.0673 √ó (0.68 √ó 2,025 √ó 12.5)^0.976
AGB = 0.0673 √ó (17,212.5)^0.976
AGB = 0.0673 √ó 13,789.4
AGB = 928.0 kg
```

### Step 3: Below Ground Biomass (BGB) Calculation

```
BGB = AGB √ó 0.2
BGB = 928.0 √ó 0.2
BGB = 185.6 kg
```

### Step 4: Total Biomass

```
Total Biomass = AGB + BGB
Total Biomass = 928.0 + 185.6
Total Biomass = 1,113.6 kg
```

### Step 5: Carbon Content

```
Carbon Content = Total Biomass √ó 0.47
Carbon Content = 1,113.6 √ó 0.47
Carbon Content = 523.4 kg
```

### Step 6: CO‚ÇÇ Equivalent Conversion

```
CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered = Carbon Content √ó (44/12)
CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered = 523.4 √ó 3.67
CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered = 1,920.9 kg
```

### Step 7: Climate Zone Adjustment

For Central India (Latitude 20.5937¬∞):
- This falls in the **Tropical zone** (|latitude| < 23.5¬∞)
- **Climate Factor**: 1.2

```
Adjusted CO‚ÇÇ = 1,920.9 √ó 1.2
Adjusted CO‚ÇÇ = 2,305.1 kg = 2.305 tonnes
```

### Step 8: Age-Based Growth Factor

For a 25-year-old tree:
```
Age Factor = max(0.5, 2 - (age / 50))
Age Factor = max(0.5, 2 - (25 / 50))
Age Factor = max(0.5, 2 - 0.5)
Age Factor = max(0.5, 1.5)
Age Factor = 1.5
```

### Step 9: Annual CO‚ÇÇ Sequestration Rate

```
Annual Sequestration = (Total CO‚ÇÇ √ó Growth Rate √ó Age Factor) / 100
Annual Sequestration = (2.305 √ó 1.1 √ó 1.5) / 100
Annual Sequestration = 3.803 / 100
Annual Sequestration = 0.038 tonnes/year
```

## üìä Final Results Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Above Ground Biomass** | 928.0 kg |
| **Below Ground Biomass** | 185.6 kg |
| **Total Biomass** | 1,113.6 kg |
| **Carbon Content** | 523.4 kg |
| **Total CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered** | **2.305 tonnes** |
| **Annual CO‚ÇÇ Sequestration** | **0.038 tonnes/year** |

## üåç Environmental Impact Analysis

### 1. Car Emissions Equivalent
```
Car Offset Days = 2.305 √ó 365 / 4.6
Car Offset Days = 183.0 days
```
**This tree offsets the same amount of CO‚ÇÇ as a car produces in 183 days.**

### 2. Tree Equivalency
```
Tree Years Equivalent = 2.305 / 0.022
Tree Years Equivalent = 104.8 tree-years
```
**This mature tree stores as much carbon as 105 average trees combined.**

### 3. Economic Value
```
Economic Value = 2.305 √ó $15
Economic Value = $34.58
```
**The carbon stored by this tree has a market value of approximately $34.58.**

## üîç Verification and Cross-Checks

### Alternative Calculation Method (Simple Allometric)
Using the simple allometric equation for comparison:
```
AGB = a √ó DBH^b
AGB = 0.26 √ó 45^2.5
AGB = 0.26 √ó 9,545.4
AGB = 2,481.8 kg
```

This gives a much higher result, showing why the **Chave et al. method is preferred** for mature trees as it provides more realistic estimates.

### Range Check
For a 12.5m tall Neem tree with 45cm DBH:
- **Expected range**: 1.5 - 3.5 tonnes CO‚ÇÇ
- **Our result**: 2.305 tonnes CO‚ÇÇ ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Within expected range

## üìà Growth Projection

### Future Carbon Sequestration (5-year projection)
Assuming continued growth at current rate:

| Year | Total CO‚ÇÇ (tonnes) | Additional CO‚ÇÇ | Cumulative Annual |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Year 0 (Current)** | 2.305 | - | 0.038 |
| Year 1 | 2.343 | 0.038 | 0.038 |
| Year 2 | 2.381 | 0.038 | 0.076 |
| Year 3 | 2.419 | 0.038 | 0.114 |
| Year 4 | 2.457 | 0.038 | 0.152 |
| Year 5 | 2.495 | 0.038 | 0.190 |

**Total additional CO‚ÇÇ sequestered over 5 years**: 0.190 tonnes

## üîß Implementation in Code

Here's how this calculation is implemented in our system:

```python
def calculate_tree_carbon_sequestration(height, dbh, latitude, longitude, species="Neem", age=25):
    # Step 1: Get species parameters
    species_params = {
        'wood_density': 680,  # kg/m¬≥
        'growth_rate': 1.1,
        'allometric_a': 0.26,
        'allometric_b': 2.5
    }
    
    # Step 2: Calculate AGB using Chave et al. equation
    wood_density = species_params['wood_density'] / 1000  # Convert to g/cm¬≥
    dbh_cm = dbh * 100  # Convert to cm
    
    agb = 0.0673 * ((wood_density * (dbh_cm ** 2) * height) ** 0.976)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate BGB
    bgb = agb * 0.2
    
    # Step 4: Total biomass
    total_biomass = agb + bgb
    
    # Step 5: Carbon content
    carbon_content = total_biomass * 0.47
    
    # Step 6: CO‚ÇÇ equivalent
    co2_sequestered = carbon_content * (44/12)
    
    # Step 7: Climate adjustment
    if abs(latitude) < 23.5:  # Tropical
        climate_factor = 1.2
    elif abs(latitude) < 40:  # Subtropical
        climate_factor = 1.0
    else:  # Temperate
        climate_factor = 0.8
    
    co2_sequestered *= climate_factor
    
    # Step 8: Age factor
    age_factor = max(0.5, 2 - (age / 50))
    
    # Step 9: Annual sequestration
    annual_sequestration = co2_sequestered * species_params['growth_rate'] * age_factor / 100
    
    return {
        'total_co2_sequestered_tonnes': round(co2_sequestered / 1000, 3),
        'annual_co2_sequestration_tonnes': round(annual_sequestration / 1000, 3),
        'total_biomass_kg': round(total_biomass, 2),
        'carbon_content_kg': round(carbon_content, 2),
        'climate_factor': climate_factor
    }
```
