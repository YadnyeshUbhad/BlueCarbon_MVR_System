    =========================
    
    Project: Test Mangrove Restoration Project
    Location: Mumbai Coastal Area
    Date: 2025-09-29
    
    Initial Ecosystem Assessment:
    - Existing vegetation coverage: 15%
    - Soil salinity levels: High (suitable for mangroves)
    - Water quality: Moderate
    - Biodiversity index: 2.3/10
    
    Baseline Measurements:
    - Total area surveyed: 5.2 hectares
    - Number of existing mature trees: 23
    - Average canopy height: 3.2 meters
    - Seedling survival rate (historical): 65%
    
    Environmental Conditions:
    - Average tide levels: 1.2m - 2.8m
    - Soil pH: 7.2 - 7.8
    - Temperature range: 24°C - 32°C
    - Annual rainfall: 1,200mm
    
    Pre-project Carbon Stock Estimation:
    - Above ground biomass: 12.5 tCO2e
    - Below ground biomass: 8.3 tCO2e
    - Total baseline carbon: 20.8 tCO2e
    
    Recommendations:
    - Plant native mangrove species (Rhizophora, Avicennia)
    - Regular monitoring required
    - Community engagement essential
