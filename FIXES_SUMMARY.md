# BlueCarbon MRV System - Issues Fixed âœ…

## Problems Resolved

### 1. NCCR Admin Portal "Not Found" Error âœ…
**Issue**: The main landing page (index.html) was redirecting to `/admin/login` which didn't exist.

**Fix**: Added the missing admin login route that redirects to the main admin dashboard.

```python
@admin_bp.route("/login")
def admin_login():
    """NCCR Admin Login - redirect to main admin dashboard"""
    return redirect(url_for('admin.admin_dashboard'))
```

### 2. NGO "Total Credits Earned" Not Working âœ…
**Issue**: The NGO dashboard linked to `/ngo/credits` but this route was missing, causing broken navigation.

**Fix**: Added complete NGO credits management system including:
- Credits listing page
- Real-time updates endpoint
- CSV export functionality
- Proper statistics calculation
