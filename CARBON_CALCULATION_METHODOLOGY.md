# Tree Carbon Sequestration Calculation Methodology

## üå≤ Overview
This document details the scientific methodology used to calculate carbon absorption and sequestration by trees in the BlueCarbon NGO platform. Our calculations are based on peer-reviewed research and internationally recognized forestry standards.

## üìä Input Parameters Required

### 1. **Essential Measurements**
- **Height (H)**: Tree height in meters
- **DBH**: Diameter at Breast Height (1.3m above ground) in meters
- **Latitude**: Geographic latitude for climate zone determination
- **Longitude**: Geographic longitude for regional adjustments

### 2. **Optional Parameters**
- **Species**: Tree species for species-specific wood density
- **Age**: Tree age in years for growth rate adjustments

## üî¨ Scientific Calculation Process

### Step 1: Biomass Calculation Using Allometric Equations

#### For Trees with DBH > 5cm (Primary Method)
We use the **Chave et al. (2014) tropical forest equation**:

```
AGB = 0.0673 √ó (œÅ √ó DBH¬≤ √ó H)^0.976
```

Where:
- **AGB** = Above Ground Biomass (kg)
- **œÅ** = Wood density (g/cm¬≥)
- **DBH** = Diameter at breast height (cm)
- **H** = Tree height (m)

#### For Smaller Trees (DBH ‚â§ 5cm)
We use simplified allometric equations:

```
AGB = a √ó DBH^b
```

Where `a` and `b` are species-specific allometric parameters.

### Step 2: Species-Specific Parameters

Our system includes wood density and growth parameters for major tree species:

| Species | Wood Density (kg/m¬≥) | Growth Rate | Allometric a | Allometric b |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Rhizophora** (Mangrove) | 800 | 1.2 | 0.251 | 2.46 |
| **Avicennia** (Mangrove) | 650 | 1.0 | 0.251 | 2.46 |
| **Neem** | 680 | 1.1 | 0.26 | 2.5 |
| **Banyan** | 550 | 2.0 | 0.28 | 2.6 |
| **Teak** | 650 | 1.3 | 0.24 | 2.4 |
| **Casuarina** | 600 | 1.5 | 0.25 | 2.4 |
| **Coconut Palm** | 400 | 0.8 | 0.22 | 2.3 |
| **Eucalyptus** | 500 | 2.5 | 0.21 | 2.3 |

### Step 3: Below Ground Biomass Calculation

```
BGB = AGB √ó 0.2
```

Below Ground Biomass is typically 15-30% of Above Ground Biomass. We use 20% as a conservative estimate.

### Step 4: Total Biomass

```
Total Biomass = AGB + BGB
```

### Step 5: Carbon Content Calculation

Trees store approximately 47% of their dry biomass as carbon:

```
Carbon Content = Total Biomass √ó 0.47
```

### Step 6: CO‚ÇÇ Equivalent Conversion

Carbon is converted to CO‚ÇÇ equivalent using the molecular weight ratio:

```
CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered = Carbon Content √ó (44/12) = Carbon Content √ó 3.67
```

This accounts for the fact that CO‚ÇÇ molecules (44 g/mol) are heavier than carbon atoms (12 g/mol).

### Step 7: Climate Zone Adjustment

Trees in different climate zones have varying growth rates and carbon sequestration potential:

```
Climate Factors:
- Tropical (|latitude| < 23.5¬∞): 1.2x multiplier
- Subtropical (23.5¬∞ ‚â§ |latitude| < 40¬∞): 1.0x multiplier  
- Temperate (|latitude| ‚â• 40¬∞): 0.8x multiplier
```

### Step 8: Age-Based Growth Rate Adjustment

For trees with known age:

```
Age Factor = max(0.5, 2 - (age / 50))
```

Younger trees typically sequester carbon more rapidly than older trees.

### Step 9: Annual Sequestration Rate

```
Annual CO‚ÇÇ Sequestration = (Total CO‚ÇÇ √ó Growth Rate √ó Age Factor) / 100
```

## üßÆ Complete Formula

The final comprehensive formula:

```
Total CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered (tonnes) = 
    [0.0673 √ó (œÅ √ó DBH¬≤ √ó H)^0.976 √ó 1.2 √ó 0.47 √ó 3.67 √ó Climate Factor] / 1000

Annual CO‚ÇÇ Sequestration (tonnes/year) = 
    Total CO‚ÇÇ √ó Species Growth Rate √ó Age Factor / 100
```

## üåç Environmental Impact Calculations

### 1. Car Emissions Equivalent
```
Car Offset Days = Total CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered √ó 365 / 4.6
```
(Average car emits 4.6 tonnes CO‚ÇÇ/year)

### 2. Tree Equivalent
```
Tree Years Equivalent = Total CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered / 0.022
```
(Average tree sequesters 22kg CO‚ÇÇ/year)

### 3. Economic Value
```
Economic Value (USD) = Total CO‚ÇÇ Sequestered √ó $15/tonne
```
(Based on current carbon credit market prices)
